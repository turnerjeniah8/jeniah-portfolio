                <p>My name is Jeniah Turner. I attend the University of California, Riverside. I was born and raised in California. I was able to graduate highschool with my diploma and associates degree by enrolling in a dual enrollent school. During the years in school I always had the love for technology so I decided to do some research about coding. I enrolled in a bootcamp course to learn about code and develop good practices in which I intend to use in the future. </p></div>
