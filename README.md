#What I learned
During this project I have really challenged myself. Rememberizing the correct sematic order of HTML is something I struggle with. As a learning process I was able to research the correct ways to indent, and the correct way to write sematic html. I was able to get really familiar with div classes, and how the CSS page really brings everything together. It was interesting to spend most of my time on debugging, I am really looking forward to working on this in the future and improving it drastically!
